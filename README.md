# Mind-Analytics

Using psychometrics principles and data wrangling and visualization skills, a psychological model was created using data collected on attitudes and behaviors towards COVID-19 from around the world. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were used to create the best-fitting model to represent thoughts and tendencies regarding the pandemic. The model was tested against differences in gender, age, and country of origin.
